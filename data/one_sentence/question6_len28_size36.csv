When the first paperclip touched the magnet it became a temporary magnet that is what happened to each of the paperclips as it touched the one before it.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
The magnet was turning the paperclips into temporary magnets.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
It was possible because the magnetic force from the magnet ran through the first paperclip almost making that paperclip like a magnet so it was able to pick up more.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
Kurt you were able to pick up that magnet because the energy of the first one was able to pick up more because of the energy.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnetism is going through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
"He rubs the paperclip on the magnet and it flow power through one, 2, 3 paperclips.","When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
Kurt was able to pick up all those paperclips because they are iron and magnetism can flow through iron.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
It was able to pick up all the rest because the magnetism flow through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
He is able to by letting the force go through the paperclips and making them all attract not repel because hand makes a repel and that is a magnetism of science.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
He was able to because the magnetism was going through the paperclip.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
"Well it can do that because the florescent is flowing through all of the paperclips, that is why.","When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnetism goes through the paperclip.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnetism force flows through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnet sends magnet through one paperclip to another.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnetic force went through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnetic force flows through all the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
He was able to do that because the magnetic force flows through the paperclips and creates a temporary magnet.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
The magnet made the paperclips stick on because the magnetism flowing through.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnet has enough power.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
It picked it up because the paperclips was a magnet.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnet hook all of those paperclips together because the magnetic electricity travels through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The force went through the paperclips so that made it able to pick up all those paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
He did that because the magnet has a lot of power so it picked up on paperclip then that paperclip is a temporary magnet and passes the power.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
The magnet has enough power to pick up more things. What happens is the magnetic field goes around and the clips sticks to clip and then that clips up another and so forth.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
