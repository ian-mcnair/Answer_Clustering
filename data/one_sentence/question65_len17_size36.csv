It is separate because the paper filter is liquid.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
Because the solid is too heavy to go through the paper.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
Solid is too big to go through the filter hole. Liquid is just water that can go through almost anything.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
Because the filter cannot hold the water because the filter already has water in it.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
"The holes in the filter are smaller than the solid particles, and the water particles are smaller than the holes, so the water goes through the filter while the solid will not go through.",The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
Because the particle size was too big and the filter could not hold any more water because it was wet.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
"Because when the solid touches the side, it sticks.",The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
Because the solid was bigger than the liquid so it got stuck!,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
Because she did not wet the filter and when she put the water they got wet.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
Because the materials are too big to go through the holes but the water is not too big to go through the holes in the filter.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
It stays in the filter because the solid material does not count as the solution.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
The solid does not go through the filter like the liquid because the liquid is small enough to go through the filter but the solid is too large.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
Because it is a thick.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
Because the holes in the filter are too small for the solid to go through them.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
The solid stayed in because it was too big to go through the microscopic holes in the filter paper.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
The solid stays in the filter because the particles are too big to go through but dissolved can go through because the particles are small enough.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
It stays at the top because it is too big to go through the filter and the water is just a liquid.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
The solid is hard. It cannot go through because it is not a liquid.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
Because the solute in the saturated solution dissolved and were dispersed equally. The material that did not go through was too big to go through.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
Because the materials are stuck together with water and cannot go through the tiny holes in the filter.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
Because when the water goes through the filter some water stays which helps the filter catch the sugar.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
Because it is too thick to slide down the filter.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
Because the solid stay because it is too big and water it can just go through things like that.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,1,65
Because they are big.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
The solid stayed in because it was not as watery and it was bigger chucks. The liquid is watery and so it went through.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
The solid stays in the filter because the filter's holes are too small for the liquid to go through.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
Because paper absorbent and solids cannot go through solids.,The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.,0,65
