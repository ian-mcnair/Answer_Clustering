It will happen because it is a parallel circuit not a series.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
"This will happen because the other 2 bulbs will have a its own pathway, and it is a parallel circuit.","The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
Because it is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
Because I think it is a series and series have to share and takes more power to form it.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
Because there is only one D-Cell so 3 bulbs will definitely not work worse.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
Because the bulb does not have its own path of electricity to flow.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
That happens because it is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
It happens because the 2 bulbs in the middle are connected together and they both are hooked to the wires.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
Because the bulbs are in parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
Because it is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
Because it is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
It happens because it is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
That happens because the electricity is still going around the other 2 bulbs.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
It stays lit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
That happens because just because one burns out does not mean the rest will and electricity can still flow.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
That happens because they each have their own circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
It is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
That happens because this is a series circuit. A series circuit means that if one bulb burns out they all do.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
They will stay on because it is in a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
The reason is that the bulbs are in a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
That happens because it is a parallel circuit which means it should run as long as you do not open the parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
It happens because if it is a cut off where I marked it they would still light.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
"Why, because it is a parallel circuit, and if one burns out they all burn out they all stay on.","The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
It happens because that string of lights is a parallel string of lights.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
This happens because when a parallel circuit is formed like this one the D-cell still allows the electricity to flow through the circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
Because it is a cinematic circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
The bulbs are connecting to the same circuit. It will not work.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
The magnetic force will still go through.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
Because electricity still goes through the wires to the others.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
Because it is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
That means it is a parallel circuit and if 2 bulbs burn out one will still be lit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
Because then it will not have a way to go.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
The bulb share the same D-Cell.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
The electricity will still flow through the wires to get to the other lights.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
If the 2 bulbs in the middle burns out the one on top will.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
Because it is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.","The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
