Because the salt was too small so small that you cannot see it.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",1,45
Because sand is much softer and the salt.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
Because the salt dissolved into the water and the sand did not.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
Because salt and water are a solution but sand and water is just a mixture.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
The sand got caught because it had rocks in it.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
The salt went through because when the salt and water mixed the salt dissolved a little.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
The particle size of the sand was too big to fit through the holes of the filter. While the salt particle size was too small to get caught.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",1,45
The salt did not get caught because it dissolved in the water.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
The salt went through the filter because it dissolved and the sand did not.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
Because he put water in it so the salt dissolved with the water and ran right through.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
Because salt is so small it slid through the large coffee filter. Sand is larger so it stuck to the filter.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",1,45
The salt turns to liquid like an ice cube and then to water sand does not.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
The sand was too big to fit through the tiny holes in the filter. The salt dissolved into the water and was way too small to get caught in the filter. It just went through.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
The salt went through the filter because the salt mix with water to make saltwater. Sand the sand got caught because it is just like the powder it sticks to the sides.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
The salt is smaller and is harder.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",1,45
The salt had gone away or dissolved.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
Because the sand is bigger than the salt.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",1,45
The grains of salt must be smaller than the grains of sand.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",1,45
The salt got dissolved in the water.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
Because the sand is thicker than the water. Water is smooth.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
Because the filter has smaller holes so whatever big particle will be separated.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",1,45
Maybe because in the little dish there is little holes and it will not go through it.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",1,45
The salt was small enough to go through the holes while the sand was too big to go through.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",1,45
The sand cannot go through because the water would not let the sand dissolve.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
It stayed there because of its size.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
Because the salt evaporated so it could go through and still have salt in it. While sand did not so it could not go through.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",1,45
Because salt can dissolve but sand is tiny parts of the ground.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
Because the salt dissolved in the water and the sand did not.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
Because the salt is evaporated already and the sand cannot because it is hard and it is gravel.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
The salt became a part of the water so it dissolve in the water so the salt went with the water. But the sand did not dissolve in the water because it was so bulky.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
The salt dissolved and became smaller. The sand became mud and got caught together and stayed on top.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
They have a sticky stuff that did not work.,"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",0,45
"The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.","The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.",1,45
