The clay is like wet sand and it is by the river.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
Because once the clay is picked up it is moved and dropped off outside of the mouth.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
It will end up there because clay can be broken up into such tiny parts or sediments that it is easily carried by the water and will end up probably the farthest out in the lake.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
The clay is deposited there because it is lighter so it travels farther and spreads out more.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
The deposited where I indicated because clay is a lot heavier than sand and pebbles.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
Because clay is a bigger.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
Because clay is heavier than sand so it travels farther.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
Clay deposited where I indicated because the clay is the lightest in this case.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
Because it is so light.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
Because when we did our stream table experiment the water and clay mixed and the water and the clay flowed together.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
The clay is in the river because the clay mixes in with the water.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
It is heavy so I thought it would drop off quick.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
It is deposited the farthest because it is lighter than the other ones.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
Because sand is heavier and since the sand is heavier it would go down from clay and there is a bigger amount of sand too.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
Clay is where I indicated it because clay is the lightest material so it travels the farthest.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
It was deposited because it begins to settle to the bottom because the channel is slowing its current.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
The clay is deposited where I indicated because the river has brought the clay in the lake.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
"It is deposited because the water, river is taking it away with it.","The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
The clay goes the farthest because it has the least particles.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
The clay is deposited where I indicated it because it is heaviest so it will not go as far.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
The clay is lighter so it is carried farther.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
The clay is there because it has lighter and smaller particles which makes it float to the top.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
Because clay is the lightest.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
The clay is deposited there because the clay is the lightest and everything else is heavier so it sinks.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
It is deposited there because it is lighter than sand and pebbles.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
Very near to the mouth of the river.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
The clay is very light so it can be carried farther than the sand and pebbles.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
"The clay is deposited there, because the clay has the least amount of mass so it will go farther.","The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
The clay is deposited where I indicated because the clay has the lesser mass so it is can be carried the farthest.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
It was deposited there because it has a lesser mass and therefore is carried farther than all of the other earth materials.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
The clay is where I indicated it because it is the one that gets pushed out the farthest.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
Clay is lighter than sand or pebbles so it would be easier for water to carry it farther.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
The clay is deposited where I indicated because it is the lightest.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
The clay deposit is farther because of its light weight.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
The clay is indicated where I put it because clay is soft and lines are soft too.,"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",0,3
"The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.","The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.",1,3
