If you take the same amount of water and weight it will measure to the same things.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",1,17
I chose cup 2 because it has the same water 2 has more solute.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
"The solutions have the same amount of solute, there is just more on the bottom of the cup in cup 2.","Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",1,17
I chose A because in each cup you could put 4 spoons and it dissolved. When the fifth scoop went in it did not dissolve.

Once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
My choice is A because it might weigh the same and they both is saturated.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",1,17
Because both of the cups one and 2 have the same amount of concentrations because they are both saturated.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",1,17
They are the same because once a solution is saturated it cannot go further.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",1,17
I chose cup 2 because it has more solute in it.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
I picked C because cup 2 has more solute than cup one.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Because it has more spoons of solute but it has the same amount of water.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Because there is the same amount of solvent but there is more solute in cup 2.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
"Each solution has same amount of water, which means they both hold the same amount of solute after saturation.","Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",1,17
Because they are both at the highest point of concentration.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",1,17
Because it is the same.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
It does not show how much dissolved and how much did not.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Because both cup one and 2 are already concentrated. Neither cup one or 2 can hold any more solvent.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
"Because Tabby said that the solute and water were the same and I believe him and it says that they both have the same thing on the bottom clear, material on the bottom.","Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
It clearly states that 2 has more.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Because is look like it.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Same water but more scoops.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Because both looked alike to me.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Because cup 2 have 8 spoons.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
I think that the answer is cup 2 because it has more spoons.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Because solution 2 is more concentrate because it has more spoonfuls.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
I put C because cup 2 has more spoons of solute so it would be heavier.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
"Because cup 2 has more salt, 8 spoons and because it has more material on the bottom.","Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
I put A because it is the same because it the same amount of water and only 2 scoops more than the other one.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
I would need to know how much stuff is at the bottom.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Because they have the same amount of water but cup 2 has more spoons of solute.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Both have the same because they have the same milliliters of water and they are both the same.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Cup one might have 6 spoons of solute and cup 2 has 8 spoons and both have 50 milliliters of water.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Cup one has less material on the bottom.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
Because cup one has the same amount of water but different amount of solute.,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
"The solutions both have the same amount of water, but not the same amount of clear material on the bottom. So cup one wins.","Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0,17
"Because both are saturated, and if you used 6 spoons for cup 2 both cups are still saturated.","Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",1,17
"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.","Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",1,17
