Yes. Because the sun hits the boxes and the inside gets really warm. So the thermometer will show the temp.,Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.,0,106
"Yes. The black absorbs heat and energy, plus, the container is closed so the heat would be trapped inside.",Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.,0,106
Yes. Because black heats up faster than white. Because black is a darker and the white is lighter.,Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.,0,106
No. The data will not support her answer because all it says are the materials and what she is going to do.,Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.,0,106
Yes. The black box will heat up faster than the white because the black box is darker than the white box so the white box reflects the heat and the black box collects the heat.,Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.,1,106
Yes. Yes it will because your prediction is based off of what you know and to have data to refer back to you probably will have a more accurate answer.,Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.,0,106
