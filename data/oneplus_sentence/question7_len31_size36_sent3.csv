Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",1,7
A. B because dry soil is not that high than the water one.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
B. because A has the highest temperature and B has the lowest.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
B. Because line A is hotter. Water tends to get hotter than anything. So the soil is line B. Soil cannot get as hot as 44 to 43 Celsius.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. Because soil heats up faster.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. The graph helped me by showing the temperature. The dry soil is darker with no heat sink material like water to slow the absorption of heat.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. Dry soil heats up quickly and more than water but loses its heat quickly like line A on the graph.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",1,7
A. Because dry soil heats more in the sun.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. The graph helped me decide which container had the dry soil because I know that water is a heat sink and I know that heat sinks bring in heat slower and lets it out slow.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",1,7
A. Had wet soil it takes a longer time for it to heat up. So the dry soil would heat up faster.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
B. The graph helped me because dry soil is not a heat sink like water so it does not absorb the heat as fast.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
"B. Well, I know that water will heat up faster and I thought that maybe the soil will not heat up faster.","A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. A because dry heats up faster because it has no breeze or moisten anything to where is absorbs more.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. Because dry soil absorbs solar energy faster because it is not a heat sink.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. Because water is a heat sink so it heats up slowly and soil heats up quickly.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. Because it heats up faster.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. The graph help me because I know that dry soil is black which perhaps it will get hotter unlike the water it reflects the sun's energy.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. Water makes things cooler so the dry soil gets hotter.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. I know that container A had the dry soil because dry soil heats up the fastest in the sun and goes down in the shade.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
B. The graph helped me decide which container had dry soil because I know that water is a better heat sink and wet soil has water in it.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. A was the highest because dry soil heats faster.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. Container A had dry soil because non wet materials or dry materials will heat up faster than wet materials because wet materials are heat sinks and they take longer to absorb and release heat.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",1,7
A. Dry soil is A because dry soil is a earth material and absorbs the sun's energy more than B.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. It helped me because container A has the highest temperature than container B.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
A. Water is a heat sink and will heat up slow but there is no water in dry soil so it heats up fast.,"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.",0,7
"A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.","A.
