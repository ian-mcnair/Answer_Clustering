Yes because there is enough power for it to work but it will be bright and it is a parallel circuit.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
No she cannot. Why is because she only has one switch and she has to have 2 for both to work.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
No. She cannot because the switch has to be in front of the negative sign.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
"No, because the switch can only complete one circuit at a time.",No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
Yes. Because it is a parallel circuit and they can both run well.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
"No. The switch can only be hooked on one side at one time, unless you scooted the wires to the middle and hooked them up together.",No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
"No, It is not a complete circuit.",No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
No because she need a wire and a switch.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
"No, she cannot because the switch can only go one way and make a complete circuit.",No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
No! The switch cannot be left and right at the same time.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
No she cannot. She would have to turn the switch like this sideways Because there is a gap if you turn it left or right.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
No because the negative on the side for the bulb might have to have the energy from the motor going in and it will go back and forth.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
No because the light bulb will flicker and the motor will keep going until she turns the switch off.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
No because it cannot make a complete circuit going each way.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
Yes because the motor is sending the energy back to the light bulb and back.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
Yes. She could put 2 wires on the switch to the other wires.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
Yes because the battery has enough power to run both unless the switch is on.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
No because the switch cannot go 2 ways at once.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
Yes. But all will have to be together.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
No she cannot because she only has one switch.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
Yes because all she has to do is put the motor and the light bulb on the same wire and put the switch in the middle.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
She can do it but it would have to be a parallel circuit.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
"Yes, we all tried it in class and it worked.",No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
"Yes, because the wires are connected to both items.",No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
Yes she can because the flow will go all the way to the source.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
Well she could try the light would not work as strong as the motor.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
No she would need 2 switches.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
"No, she would have to have 2 switches.",No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
"Yes, because the flow of electricity will go to the light and then to the motor.",No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
No because she can only turn the switch to the light bulb or the motor.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
"No, because there is not going to be a closed circuit on both sides.",No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
No Because she can turn one on at a time.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
No because the D-cell in the middle.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
Yes.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
Yes she can. Because that is how you have to do it.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
"She can run both at the same time because, if it is going to the negative and to the positive and all the components are set up correctly in the right way it will work.",No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,0,57
No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.,1,57
