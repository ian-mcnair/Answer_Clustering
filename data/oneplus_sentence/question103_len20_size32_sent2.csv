It is harder to use this system than to use a single fixed pulley system.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
You have to pull up and in the other system you will pull down.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
The system is single movable system but the single fixed is easier to pull down.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
Pull down.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
It has direction advantage it can go up and down.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
In a single fixed gravity creates a directional advantage. But in this one gravity pulls against you when pulling up.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
You have to pull more ropes and a single fixed requires more effort.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
You have to use more effort because you pull down.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
The amount of ropes supporting it.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
Single fixed pulley system a smaller effort and only one mechanical advantage.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
Single fixed only has one rope connected to the load.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
There are more materials.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
You do not have to pull much rope with the single fixed but it is heavier.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
"The other disadvantage to this system is the effort is going up, so gravity is working against you.","You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
The disadvantage is distance in this one and in a single fixed it is that the load's weight stays the same the whole time.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
This system would take longer to set up.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
Another disadvantage would be you have to pull more rope to get it where you want it to go.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
The effort is going up which makes it harder.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
"You would have to pull 3 times as much on this than you would a single fixed. Also, it is easier to pull down than up.","You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
"You have to pull up. It may give you mechanical advantage, but it does not give you directional advantage so it takes just as much work.","You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
"Single fixed you can pull down, which does not give you a mechanical advantage. But you do not pull the rope farther than the load.","You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
This pulley system gives you a mechanical advantage the single fixed gives directional advantage.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
Distance.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
Another disadvantage might be that you cannot lift the load as high as you can in the single fixed because you are using more string.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
You have to pull twice as much rope to lift the load.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
A mechanical advantage. A single fixed pulley gives you a directional advantage.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
Another disadvantage might be the size of the load. 360 newtons is quite a large load to be pulling upward!,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
You have to use less effort.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",0,103
"Compared to a single fixed pulley system, you would not have a directional advantage.","You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
You do not have a directional advantage.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
You have to pull up on this pulley system. On the single fixed you get a directional advantage.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
This system has a directional disadvantage and the single fixed has a mechanical disadvantage.,"You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.",1,103
