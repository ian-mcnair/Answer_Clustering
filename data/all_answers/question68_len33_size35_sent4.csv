A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
More water can cause more erosion because so much water is flowing through at a time. Also a steeper slope because the water will flow a lot faster.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",1,68
"Steep slopes can have landslides, faster water can gush. To be a flood plus massively erode.","A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
"If you use a water source with a bigger hole, more water will come out which will cause erosion. If you make the slope steeper, the water will run down faster.","A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
The erosion will happen faster because the flow of the water is stronger and faster so the material will be worn down more.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
I choose water source with a bigger hole because the more water the more momentum to destroy. I chose a slope because the water will travel fast.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",1,68
A bigger water hole would allow more water to come through faster. Making the slope steeper and water would run through faster.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
"More water will make it faster to erode, a steeper hill will make it go faster down hill.","A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
"Well, they change the way erosion goes faster or lower and if it slides or not.","A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
My house because more erosion because it is a greater mass.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
So everything would happen quicker and better.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
My choices cause more erosion because with a bigger hole more water comes out faster and when the slope is steeper the water goes down faster and very powerfully.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
My choice increases water speed and the faster something is going the more it can hold.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
Because the more water going at a faster pace because of the slopes will cause more erosion because gravity will help slope.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
If the hole is bigger that will cause a flood. More water the more velocity causing more erosion. Also if make the slope steeper that will cause the velocity to be greater causing more erosion.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",1,68
My choices cause more erosion because if you have a bigger hole more water can pour through and if the slope is steeper water will come down harder.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",0,68
They cause more erosion because there is more water flowing out the hole making a flood and when it is elevated it makes the water move faster moving more sediment.,"A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.",1,68
Making a bigger hole causes more water which makes it flow faster causing more erosion.
