The batteries are negative to negative.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
It will not run because negative and negative and positive and positive are facing the same way.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",1,92
Because the wires in between the D-cells are connected to the same end.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
It is go out the wrong way.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
The 2 negative ends of the D-cells are facing each other and the electricity cannot get out.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",1,92
"Both of the motors are hooked up to the positive wire, in order for it to work one has to be hooked to a positive and the other has to be hooked up to a negative.","The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",1,92
They will not run because the electricity is going in a circle. And the electricity would be run in and out.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
The motors at the right will not run because the electricity flows out of the negative side and they have the D-cells trying to make electricity flow out the positive side.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
One battery is the wrong way.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
It will not run because there is not enough D-cells to make both of them work.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
Because a negative and a negative will not work.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",1,92
The motor shall not run because electricity flows out of the negative side of the battery.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
The motors will not run because the D-cells has to be switched around.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
They will not run because the electricity gets stopped when it goes through the D-cells.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
The motors shown at the right will not run because 2 negatives are connected.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",1,92
The wires are not supposed to be connected like that.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
Because you need more wires.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
Because the motors do not have a minus side. They both have a positive side.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
The motor at the right will not run because each one does not have a positive and a negative.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
Because positive is facing it.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
Maybe the left wire went out of energy so maybe the right one went out of energy so both of them are out.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
If you look very closely the positive to positive and negative to negative. Positive and positive do not go together.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
It will not work because it is dead battery.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
Because one has the most power than the other one.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
Because one D-cell has to be between the motors.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
The motor will not run because it is in an open circuit.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
The wires are at the negative end of the battery or D-cell so the motor is not going to run because the wire is at the negative end.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
The D-cell is hooked up to the negative end and the other negative end and it cannot get any energy.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",1,92
The negative end is pointing at the negative end so no electricity can flow to the motors.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",1,92
The negative end are sharing so the D-cell is getting all the power.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",0,92
Because electricity does not flow from positive to positive they flow from negative to positive.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",1,92
"The electricity is flowing from a positive to a positive end, when the negative should give the electricity to the motor and back to a positive end.","The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",1,92
