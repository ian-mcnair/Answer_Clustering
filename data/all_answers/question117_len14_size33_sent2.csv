No because no solid that one has more than the other in the same amount of water.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
No not all mixtures and solutions come out correct he needs to let it sit or he should let or he should let I stir it.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
Yes because different materials have different solubility.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Yes because different solids have different solubility is. Janet and Mike used different solids. They are wrong.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Yes it is possible both solubility's are correct different solubility's very possible because some substances are more able to dissolve in less space than others.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Yes because the water has different materials in it and the materials have different atoms and stuff and that makes changes to what happens to them in water and their solubility.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
No because it has 2 different chemicals and it does not have the same solubilities.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
Yes because they are whole new materials.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Because they are different ingredients.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Yes because they are 2 different ingredients.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Yes because the solubility is of mixtures are not all the same.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Yes because they are different materials.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Yes because they are both different.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Yes it is.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
What do you mean I do not how what you are say to me so can you help me.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
Yes because all material move in a different way.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Because they are different things. Nitrate is different then chloride so they cannot be the same weight. Just like a monkey and a elephant.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
Yes because all materials have different grams.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
Yes because they are 2 different things.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
No because silver chloride is different than silver nitrate.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
No because silver chloride is different than silver nitrate.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
They are correct because the materials are 2 whole different materials.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Yes because something else can have the exact same thing and it does not have to be like that.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
No because only a certain amount of solid can dissolve in a certain amount of water. They both got different solubility in the same amount of water which mean somebody did something wrong.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
The fizzing means that it came from the gas.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
Yes they can do it different but be the same way.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
No because they are different grams.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
No because they might weigh different.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
Yes because Janet used silver chloride and Mike used silver nitrate which means if they used 2 different things they both could be right.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
Yes because both the silver thing are different and they weigh different.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
No because they used different chemicals so that why it is not the same and also because they used different sizes.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
It could be possible chance it is correct but there could also be a 50 chance it is right and a 50 50 chance it is wrong. If they do not know they could do some test and research.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
Yes because silver nitrate might be heavier.,"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",0,117
"Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.","Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.",1,117
