I decided it would be 6 Celsius for 10 minutes because it is counting by 3's. Also because the bigger it gets the hotter it would be.,"20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.",1,16
Because it has the size between 10 centimeters and 3 centimeters and if you look at the table the temperature should be the middle.,"20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.",1,16
The one that is 20 centimeters longer will not get as hot. Because it is longer. Because the longer it is the more time it takes.,"20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.",0,16
I decided what the temperature was going to be because if you look at 10 minutes it will look like its going up by 3's.,"20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.",0,16
I decide that the temperature is going to be less.,"20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.",0,16
It would be less because it will be smaller than the other solar heater except the 10 centimeters one.,"20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.",0,16
I think the new temperature change would be 6 because I look at it it looks like it adding by 3 so that I would think would be the temperature change.,"20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.",0,16
"20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.","20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.",1,16
