I think it will just be the same temperature. Because it is the same shape.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
X and Y both have the same solar water heater so the temperature will be the same.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
Because I think it might be higher.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
"They both are the same size, have the same water amount, and are left out for the same time.",The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
Because the temperature would just go higher.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
Because until you get to 5 minute to 25 minute these different numbers but until the 30 it goes down and sometimes it could be the same.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
More? Because they are not facing at the same direction the Y is facing right and the X is facing left.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
I chose less than because X is a little bit more smaller.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
Because water really does not change very much.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
"Same, because they are the same size triangles and in the same size boxes, with the same amount of water.",The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
I think the temperature will stay the same because they are the same shapes.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
Because the solar water heaters are the same size and there is the same amount of water in each container.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
I think they would both heat up the same because they are the same size and shape just faced a different way.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
Because they look the same so it would be the same.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
They both have the same amount of surface area in the container and are filled with the same amount of water.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
It would be the same because they both have the same amount of water and they are the same size.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
"I think same because they both have the same amount of black and the surface area look the same, and they are both the same shape.",The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
I think X and Y's temperature would be the same because it is the same just flipped.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
It would be the same because for it to be greater than or less than it depends where you put the solar water heater.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
It would be greater than because the cover on X is bigger than the one on Y.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
I think it would be the same because there is no change in variables.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
"It would be the same because it does not matter what position the black surface area is, it matters what size.",The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
I think the same because both the heaters are the same.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
"They have the same surface area, just flipped so they will heat equally.",The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
The triangles are the same size.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
I chose same because they are the same figure and size. Y is facing the other way though it is still the same.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
Because they are the same size and same color so it is going to be the same temperature.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
Because they both have the same amount of water.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,0,36
Because if you put something in at the same time it will get the same results as the other one.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,1,36
The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.,The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size.
