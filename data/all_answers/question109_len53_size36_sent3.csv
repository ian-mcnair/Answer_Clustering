If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.",0,109
I chose this answer because it could be blocked or it could be attracted.,"You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.",0,109
Depends on how powerful the magnets are.,"You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets.
