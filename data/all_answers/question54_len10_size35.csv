Greater than because mixture 5 has the same amount of water with more spoons of solid.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
Greater than because it have 5 spoon of clear material.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
Mixture 5 because they have the same amount of water but mixture 5 has more spoon.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
Greater than mixture 4.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
It is the same because it has the same stuff at the bottom.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
"The same because in the picture of mixture 4 and 5, they show the same salt on the bottom.",The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,1,54
They are the same and equal concentrated.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
"Mixtures is the same concentration, because both of the mixtures are saturated.",The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,1,54
It is greater than because mixture 4 has more room to dissolve than mixture 5.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
"The same, because both solutions have the same saturation point so they have the same concentration and amount of solid.",The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,1,54
The same because they both reached the saturation point.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,1,54
They are the same amount concentrated because they have the same amount of water and dissolved material.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,1,54
It is greater than because they have the same amount of water but 5 has one more spoon than 4.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
They are the same because once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,1,54
The same because once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,1,54

The same because both solutions are saturated.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,1,54
No because 5 has more scoops than 4.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
Same because if they all have the same water and 4 is concentrated with 4 scoops and 5 with 5 scoops then the solubility is the same because of the same amount of water become crystal.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,1,54
Same as mixture 4 because you cannot see them.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
Mixture 5 is greater than mixture 4 because it has the same amount of water and at the bottom it is both clear material but it does not have the same amount of solid.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
No because there is one extra spoon in 5.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,0,54
Same because they are both saturated and it can only hold an equal amount.,The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.,1,54
