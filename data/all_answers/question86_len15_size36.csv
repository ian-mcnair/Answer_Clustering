As the blocks increase the distance decreases.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
"The more blocks you put on the truck the farther it gets, in meters.","The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
"As the number of blocks increases, the distance increase.","The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The relationship is as the number of blocks increases the distance decreases.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The more blocks the shorter the distance traveled.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
Once he added one more the mass was slower and that is what he showed on the graph.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The distance goes up one every time also the number of blocks.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
It went farther with less blocks and it went no farther with more blocks.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The relationship between the independent and the dependent variable is the more load the slower the truck will go.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
One shows the number of blocks and one shows the distance of how far they went.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The more blocks the harder the truck tries to go faster causing it to go slower.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
Every time he put a block in it went 5 meters shorter.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86

The relationship is it goes down one every time you add a block.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
The relationship between the number of blocks and the distance traveled by the truck in 10 seconds is that they both change how far the truck goes.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The relationship is that the less blocks the toy truck has the more it will carry and the more blocks the less it can carry.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
The relationship between the number of blocks and the distance is that it decreases every time and all of it decreases together.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The relationship is that the more blocks that you put in the truck the less distance it will cover.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
The more blocks he puts in the truck the less the truck will travel.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
That it is increasing by the matter of seconds.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The more number of blocks the less distance it goes or the less block the more distance.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
The number of blocks is measuring by meters.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
If the truck has less blocks it goes further.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
The more blocks you add the less distance it would go. It would have more mass.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
The more blocks Don added the slower the toy truck will go.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
That will more number of blocks the slower it goes.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The distance of the meter is going lower. The number of blocks is going lower too.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The distance of the meter is going lower. Number of blocks is getting lower too.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The more blocks added the farther it went.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The more blocks the less it goes.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
It goes up each one.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",0,86
The relationship is that each time he add a block it goes about one meter lower.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
The more blocks the less it will go.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
The more blocks it carried the less farther it would go.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
The more blocks the less meters it goes.,"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
"The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.","The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.",1,86
