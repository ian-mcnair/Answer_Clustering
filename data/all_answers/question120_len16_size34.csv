More than one manipulated variable.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
It has too many manipulated variables it could not give the same information.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
I think red reflected the heat away.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Maybe because they are each different types.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because one is covered and the other is not covered.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because they are different colors.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
I think it is covered more than the red one. And put does too color because is almost the same.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because the red uncovered get colder and the blue get hotter.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
It would not be useful because red is uncovered and blue is covered and it is not fair.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
I think that the red covered was not in the sun.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
"Maybe the blue uncovered would be the same as the red or not, just to make sure.","When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
Because you would not know the readings of blue uncovered and red covered.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
Because both of them are different one is uncovered and another is covered.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because it will just be in the middle of hot and cold.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because you do not have enough information to compare the data.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because it is only 2 colors.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because the red uncovered has a low temperature and blue covered has a high temperature.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because if they are different color and covered and uncovered you would get way different data.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
The red does not heat up fast as the blue covered.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
It would not provide useful information because you would not know if either red covered or blue covered absorbed most heat or if red uncovered or blue uncovered absorbed most heat.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
It will not be only little information and also there is not test of red covered and blue uncovered.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
It would not provide useful information because you would also need to know how much the blue heated up covered to.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because then you would not be controlling the variables.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
Because it did not use all the colors so they could not find out what one heated up more.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because they have 2 variables changed lid or no lid and color are the 2 they changed.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
It would not tell the difference if blue is warmer the red or uncover heat up slower than cover.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
Because you are comparing 2 thing and it would not make any sense because you know black heats faster than white.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because they are the same temperature.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
I chose that because when the plastic is darker it will heat faster than a light color.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
That will not not provide useful information because you would only know blue covered red uncovered.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
Because red uncovered is smaller than the blue covered heater.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Uncovered versus covered would not help but both of each would.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
Because they are both covered.,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",0,120
"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.","When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",1,120
