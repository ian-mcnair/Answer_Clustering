"The magnet magnetized the first one, then it a temporary magnet and then the next one.","When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
He magnetized it for a minute.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
Because it lets magnetism through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
He was able to do that because the magnetism traveled through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
The magnetism went through the first paperclip to the rest.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
When you pick up a object that object acts like it is a magnet.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
Because if the magnet touches the one paperclip became a temporary magnet and when another paperclip hooked that other paperclip worked like a magnet.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
The magnet's force go through the first paperclip to the last paperclip.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
When the first paperclip touched the magnet it became a temporary magnet that is what happened to each of the paperclips as it touched the one before it.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
The magnet was turning the paperclips into temporary magnets.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
It was possible because the magnetic force from the magnet ran through the first paperclip almost making that paperclip like a magnet so it was able to pick up more.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
Kurt you were able to pick up that magnet because the energy of the first one was able to pick up more because of the energy.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnetism is going through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
"He rubs the paperclip on the magnet and it flow power through one, 2, 3 paperclips.","When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
Kurt was able to pick up all those paperclips because they are iron and magnetism can flow through iron.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
It was able to pick up all the rest because the magnetism flow through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
He is able to by letting the force go through the paperclips and making them all attract not repel because hand makes a repel and that is a magnetism of science.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
He was able to because the magnetism was going through the paperclip.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
"Well it can do that because the florescent is flowing through all of the paperclips, that is why.","When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6

The magnetic force went through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnetic force flows through all the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
He was able to do that because the magnetic force flows through the paperclips and creates a temporary magnet.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
The magnet made the paperclips stick on because the magnetism flowing through.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnet has enough power.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
It picked it up because the paperclips was a magnet.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The magnet hook all of those paperclips together because the magnetic electricity travels through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The force went through the paperclips so that made it able to pick up all those paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
He did that because the magnet has a lot of power so it picked up on paperclip then that paperclip is a temporary magnet and passes the power.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6
The magnet has enough power to pick up more things. What happens is the magnetic field goes around and the clips sticks to clip and then that clips up another and so forth.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
They could pick up paperclips because the magnetism went through the paperclips.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
It is flowing though the magnet so it works.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The first paperclips gets strong and give it to these conduct and they are one.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",0,6
The paperclip is attaching like a temporary magnet.,"When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.",1,6

It will happen because it is a parallel circuit not a series.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
"This will happen because the other 2 bulbs will have a its own pathway, and it is a parallel circuit.","The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
Because it is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
Because I think it is a series and series have to share and takes more power to form it.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
Because there is only one D-Cell so 3 bulbs will definitely not work worse.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
Because the bulb does not have its own path of electricity to flow.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
That happens because it is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
It happens because the 2 bulbs in the middle are connected together and they both are hooked to the wires.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31

It stays lit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
That happens because just because one burns out does not mean the rest will and electricity can still flow.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
That happens because they each have their own circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
It is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31

They will stay on because it is in a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
The reason is that the bulbs are in a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
That happens because it is a parallel circuit which means it should run as long as you do not open the parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
It happens because if it is a cut off where I marked it they would still light.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
"Why, because it is a parallel circuit, and if one burns out they all burn out they all stay on.","The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
It happens because that string of lights is a parallel string of lights.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
This happens because when a parallel circuit is formed like this one the D-cell still allows the electricity to flow through the circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
Because it is a cinematic circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
The bulbs are connecting to the same circuit. It will not work.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
The magnetic force will still go through.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31

Because it is a parallel circuit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
That means it is a parallel circuit and if 2 bulbs burn out one will still be lit.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",1,31
Because then it will not have a way to go.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
The bulb share the same D-Cell.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
The electricity will still flow through the wires to get to the other lights.,"The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.",0,31
